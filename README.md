# we
Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/start.html), [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). A great first language and a great next language to learn after Scratch. Head over to the [website](https://b1nus.github.io/crust/) to start coding. Have fun!

# Goals
- Easy to iterate (learn from zig's mistakes) (hotreloading)
- Super (almost too) simple building blocks
- Beginner-friendly errors (simple terminology, short but clear errors with example solutions)
- Automatic error correction (":" before types for example) ("loop","for","while" instead of "repeat"). We don't change the file without permission but we compile/run the program with corrections.
- Remember the code a user wrote so it doesn't disapear once they exit. alternatively prompt the user to save their work when they they try and close the website.

Look [what people are able to do in geometry dash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I02aKeqgpM). It's not built for this, but creative people still find a way. I love this so much.
# Simplicity Idea Nuggets
- Arbitrary sized integers are actually easy to implement. Make it all into i64 in wasm. and mask out the number
- Larger integers than i64 is also not very hard. i69 would be two i64. Implement this progressively with harder functions as you progress. Use function composition.
- Arbitrary code run at compile time using function<constant1, constant2, ... >(). repeat, if etc just work. calling another non generic functions works as well if the input is constant.
- Functions implicitly return and reassign their arguments.

Note: I need to do more market research. I don't understand my target audience at all.

Use simple words! Always. List is better than DynamicArrayList. etc.

At first glance, you don't seem to have enough features. but you do, you need to be creative. Just like in scratch.
# DEVNOTES: Website:
- Hotreloading. Just restart it for now, but make it only restart if necessary otherwise.
- Interactive helper. Haven't though to much of the details, but it's more or less a necessity.
- Auto indent. Tab and Tab remove easily.
# Mvp
- only wasm core
- only wasi preview 1
- only f64
# Developer notes
- Remember K.I.S.S:
- No expression statements
- No functions inside functions
- No capital letters
- No implicit return
- No add/sud/mul/div assign
- No swap optimisation
- No indexing syntax
- No default arguments
- No structs/enums
- No implicit types in bindings
- No error/crash messages
- No stacktraces
- No function overloading
- No methods
- No comptime
- No metaprogramming
- No bindings without initial expression
- No root indentation
- No function overriding

# Error handling
Just assertions. Avoid crashing with if statements.
> [!NOTE]
> Crashes show the assert that failed. We rely on good naming to make it obvious why it failed.
# Shadowing
Redeclare a variable to shadow it.
# Pointers
CHOPPING BLOCK -> Nope.
# Mutability
Everything is mutable.
# Memory
Memory is deallocated once a variable goes out of scope.
# Functions
All parameters are mutable. Functions are strongly typed.

CHOPPING BLOCK -> Functions cannot use variables from the outside, only their parameters.
# Numbers
- We have 5 kinds of number literals. Floats `1.5`, Decimal `58`, Hexadecimal `0x4B`, Binary `0b01001011`, and Character `"a"`.
- Compiler error if the literal is too big or too small.
- Chars can be any [utf-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) code point.
- f32 and f64 follow the normal rules of [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).
# Strings
Strings are lists of numbers. `"Hello, World!"` is of type `[u8]` and each character is an element in the list. This is wasteful but very simple.
# Comments
Comments start with `//`.
# Boolean Expresssions
Chained boolean expressions `0 < x <= 10` are allowed. Ambiguous expressions such as `x and y or z` are not allowed.
# `use`
The `use` keyword imports code from local files, `use stuff/functions.crs`. You can give imported functions a namespace with the `as` keyword: `use stuff/function.crs as funcs`. Use a function from the imported file using dot syntax `x = funcs.function(args)`.
> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to add the right line numbers and file names in error messages.
